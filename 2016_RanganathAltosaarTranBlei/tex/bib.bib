@article{Hinton2006,
	Abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

	Abstract = {MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the ``folk knowledge'' that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning a generative model of natural language sentences together with their formal meaning representations with hierarchical structures. The model is applied to the task of mapping sentences to hierarchical representations of their underlying meaning. We introduce dynamic programming techniques for efficient training and decoding. In experiments, we demonstrate that the model, when coupled with a discriminative reranking technique, achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on two publicly available corpora. The generative model degrades robustly when presented with instances that are different from those seen in training. This allows a notable improvement in recall compared to previous models.},

@article{Bengio2003,
	Abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

Instead of considering Spam filtering as a standard classification problem, we highlight the importance of considering specific characteristics of the problem, especially concept drift, in designing new filters. Two particularly important aspects not widely recognized in the literature are discussed: the difficulties in updating a classifier based on the bag-of-words representation and a major difference between two early naive Bayes models. Overall, we conclude that while important advancements have been made in the last years, several aspects remain to be explored, especially under more realistic evaluation settings. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@book{Stroustrup2013a,
	Abstract = {The C++11 standard allows programmers to express ideas more clearly, simply, and directly, and to write faster, more efficient code. Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, thoroughly covers the details of this language and its use in his definitive reference, The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition. In A Tour of C++, Stroustrup excerpts the overview chapters from that complete reference, expanding and enhancing them to give an experienced programmer-in just a few hours-a clear idea of what constitutes modern C++. In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library components-not, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started. Stroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11. This guide does not aim to teach you how to program (see Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ for that); nor will it be the only resource you'll need for C++ mastery (see Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, for that). If, however, you are a C or C++ programmer wanting greater familiarity with the current C++ language, or a programmer versed in another language wishing to gain an accurate picture of the nature and benefits of modern C++, you can't find a shorter or simpler introduction than this tour provides.},

It is easy to give algebraic structure to some models, and we do this ex- plicitly for Bayesian classifiers and a novel variation of decision stumps called HomS- tumps. But not all classifiers have an ob- vious structure, so we introduce the Free HomTrainer. This can be used to give a ``generic'' algebraic structure to any classi- fier. We use the Free HomTrainer to give al- gebraic structure to bagging and boosting. In so doing, we derive novel online and parallel algorithms, and present the first fast cross- validation schemes for these classifiers},

	Abstract = {We present a framework for efficient inference in structured image models that explicitly reason about objects. We achieve this by performing probabilistic inference using a recurrent neural network that attends to scene elements and processes them one at a time. Crucially, the model itself learns to choose the appropriate number of inference steps. We use this scheme to learn to perform inference in partially specified 2D models (variable-sized variational auto-encoders) and fully specified 3D models (probabilistic renderers). We show that such models learn to identify multiple objects - counting, locating and classifying the elements of a scene - without any supervision, e.g., decomposing 3D images with various numbers of objects in a single forward pass of a neural network. We further show that the networks produce accurate inferences when compared to supervised counterparts, and that their structure leads to improved generalization.},

	Abstract = {The modern musician enjoys access to a staggering number of audio samples. Composition software can ship with many gigabytes of data, and there are many more to be found online. However, conventional methods for navigating these libraries are still quite rudimentary, and often involve scrolling through alphabetical lists. We present a system for sample exploration that allows audio clips to be sorted according to user taste, and arranged in any desired 2D formation such that similar samples are located near each other. Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.},

	Abstract = {We discuss an autoencoder model in which the encoding and decoding functions are implemented by decision trees. We use the soft decision tree where internal nodes realize soft multivariate splits given by a gating function and the overall output is the average of all leaves weighted by the gating values on their path. The encoder tree takes the input and generates a lower dimensional representation in the leaves and the decoder tree takes this and reconstructs the original input. Exploiting the continuity of the trees, autoencoder trees are trained with stochastic gradient descent. On handwritten digit and news data, we see that the autoencoder trees yield good reconstruction error compared to traditional autoencoder perceptrons. We also see that the autoencoder tree captures hierarchical representations at different granularities of the data on its different levels and the leaves capture the localities in the input space.},

Omitting the prior leads to the standard KL-NMF algorithms as special cases, where maximum likelihood parameter estimation is carried out via the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Starting from this view, we develop full Bayesian inference via variational Bayes or Monte Carlo. Our construction retains conjugacy and enables us to develop more powerful models while retaining attractive features of standard NMF such as monotonic convergence and easy implementation.

	Abstract = {The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated mechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand, the collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological models from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black boxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this way, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, characterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same range of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that function as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the procedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48 parameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a single adaptation parameter {\$}\backslashtau{\$} characterizing the ratio of time scales for the initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling in physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized into simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters.},

	Abstract = {We describe a simple neural language model that relies only on character-level inputs. Predictions are still made at the word-level. Our model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway network over characters, whose output is given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM). On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60{\%} fewer parameters. On languages with rich morphology (Czech, German, French, Spanish, Russian), the model consistently outperforms a Kneser-Ney baseline and word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with far fewer parameters. Our results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling.},

@article{Neelakantan2015,
	Abstract = {Knowledge base (KB) completion adds new facts to a KB by making inferences from existing facts, for example by inferring with high likelihood nationality(X,Y) from bornIn(X,Y). Most previous methods infer simple one-hop relational synonyms like this, or use as evidence a multi-hop relational path treated as an atomic feature, like bornIn(X,Z) -{\textgreater} containedIn(Z,Y). This paper presents an approach that reasons about conjunctions of multi-hop relations non-atomically, composing the implications of a path using a recursive neural network (RNN) that takes as inputs vector embeddings of the binary relation in the path. Not only does this allow us to generalize to paths unseen at training time, but also, with a single high-capacity RNN, to predict new relation types not seen when the compositional model was trained (zero-shot learning). We assemble a new dataset of over 52M relational triples, and show that our method improves over a traditional classifier by 11{\%}, and a method leveraging pre-trained embeddings by 7{\%}.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new approach for representing biological sequences. This method, named protein-vectors or ProtVec for short, can be utilized in bioinformatics applications such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. Using the Skip-gram neural networks, protein sequences are represented with a single dense n-dimensional vector. This method was evaluated by classifying protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families where an average family classification accuracy of {\$}94\backslash{\%}\backslashpm 0.03\backslash{\%}{\$} was obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, our model was used to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences were used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences were distinguished from structured Protein Data Bank (PDB) sequences with 99.81$\backslash${\%} accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0$\backslash${\%} accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, information about protein structure can be determined with high accuracy. This so-called embedding model needs to be trained only once and can then be used to ascertain a diverse set of information regarding the proteins of interest. In addition, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important as- pect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for to- day's multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In the past few years there have beenmany studies claimingGPUs deliver substantial speedups (be- tween 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after ap- plying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the per- formance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7 960 processor narrows to only 2.5x on average. In this pa- per, we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance dif- ferences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in ar- chitectural efficiency for throughput kernels.},

	Abstract = {For discrete data, the likelihood {\$}P(x){\$} can be rewritten exactly and parametrized into {\$}P(X = x) = P(X = x | H = f(x)) P(H = f(x)){\$} if {\$}P(X | H){\$} has enough capacity to put no probability mass on any {\$}x'{\$} for which {\$}f(x')\backslashneq f(x){\$}, where {\$}f(\backslashcdot){\$} is a deterministic discrete function. The log of the first factor gives rise to the log-likelihood reconstruction error of an autoencoder with {\$}f(\backslashcdot){\$} as the encoder and {\$}P(X|H){\$} as the (probabilistic) decoder. The log of the second term can be seen as a regularizer on the encoded activations {\$}h=f(x){\$}, e.g., as in sparse autoencoders. Both encoder and decoder can be represented by a deep neural network and trained to maximize the average of the optimal log-likelihood {\$}\backslashlog p(x){\$}. The objective is to learn an encoder {\$}f(\backslashcdot){\$} that maps {\$}X{\$} to {\$}f(X){\$} that has a much simpler distribution than {\$}X{\$} itself, estimated by {\$}P(H){\$}. This "flattens the manifold" or concentrates probability mass in a smaller number of (relevant) dimensions over which the distribution factorizes. Generating samples from the model is straightforward using ancestral sampling. One challenge is that regular back-propagation cannot be used to obtain the gradient on the parameters of the encoder, but we find that using the straight-through estimator works well here. We also find that although optimizing a single level of such architecture may be difficult, much better results can be obtained by pre-training and stacking them, gradually transforming the data distribution into one that is more easily captured by a simple parametric model.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge tracing---where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework---is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high ed-ucational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neu-ral networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and dis-covery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.},

	Abstract = {The deep learning approach to machine learning emphasizes high-capacity, scalable models that learn distributed representations of their input. This dissertation demonstrates the efficacy and generality of this approach in a series of diverse case studies in speech recognition, computational chemistry, and natural language processing. Throughout these studies, I extend and modify the neural network models as needed to be more effective for each task. In the area of speech recognition, I develop a more accurate acoustic model using a deep neural network. This model, which uses rectified linear units and dropout, improves word error rates on a 50 hour broadcast news task. A similar neural network results in a model for molecular activity prediction substantially more effective than production systems used in the pharmaceutical industry. Even though training assays in drug discovery are not typically very large, it is still possible to train very large models by leveraging data from multiple assays in the same model and by using effective regularization schemes. In the area of natural language processing, I first describe a new restricted Boltzmann machine training algorithm suitable for text data. Then, I introduce a new neural network generative model of parsed sentences capable of generating reasonable samples and demonstrate a performance advantage for deeper variants of the model.},

Most often in network analysis, the edges are given. How-ever, in many systems it is difficult or impossible to measure the network directly. Examples of latent networks include economic in-teractions linking financial instruments and patterns of reciprocity in gang violence. In these cases, we are limited to noisy observations of events associated with each node. To enable analysis of these implicit networks, we develop a probabilistic model that combines mutually-exciting point processes with random graph models. We show how the Poisson superposition principle enables an elegant auxiliary vari-able formulation and a fully-Bayesian, parallel inference algorithm.

	Abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna- tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of ``Canada'' and ``Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain ``Air Canada''. Motivated by this example,we present a simplemethod for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

That proof of concept, while encouraging, was rather narrow. Here we consider tasks other than sentiment analysis, provide a more thorough comparison of Paragraph Vectors to other document modelling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and evaluate performance of the method as we vary the dimensionality of the learned representation. We benchmarked the models on two document similarity data sets, one from Wikipedia, one from arXiv. We observe that the Paragraph Vector method performs significantly better than other methods, and propose a simple improvement to enhance embedding quality. Somewhat surprisingly, we also show that much like word embeddings, vector operations on Paragraph Vectors can perform useful semantic results.},

	Abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets},

We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}−64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

	Abstract = {Weak topic correlation across document collections with different numbers of topics in individual collections presents challenges for existing cross-collection topic models. This paper introduces two probabilistic topic models, Correlated LDA (C-LDA) and Correlated HDP (C-HDP). These address problems that can arise when analyzing large, asymmetric, and potentially weakly-related collections. Topic correlations in weakly-related collections typically lie in the tail of the topic distribution, where they would be overlooked by models unable to fit large numbers of topics. To efficiently model this long tail for large-scale analysis, our models implement a parallel sampling algorithm based on the Metropolis-Hastings and alias methods (Yuan et al., 2015). The models are first evaluated on synthetic data, generated to simulate various collection-level asymmetries. We then present a case study of modeling over 300k documents in collections of sciences and humanities research from JSTOR.},

	Abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

	Abstract = {The standard unsupervised recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) generates sentences one word at a time and does not work from an explicit global distributed sentence representation. In this work, we present an RNN-based variational autoencoder language model that incorporates distributed latent representations of entire sentences. This factorization allows it to explicitly model holistic properties of sentences such as style, topic, and high-level syntactic features. Samples from the prior over these sentence representations remarkably produce diverse and well-formed sentences through simple deterministic decoding. By examining paths through this latent space, we are able to generate coherent novel sentences that interpolate between known sentences. We present techniques for solving the difficult learning problem presented by this model, demonstrate strong performance in the imputation of missing tokens, and explore many interesting properties of the latent sentence space.},

	Abstract = {Multivariate categorical data, such as binary or multiple choice individual responses to a set of questions, are abundant in the social sciences. These data can be recorded in a multi-way con- tingency table, which quickly becomes sparse with any practical sample size when the number of questions goes up. Latent structure models, such as latent class and latent trait models, provide a way to model the distribution of counts in a large sparse contingency table based on assump- tions about the latent structure of the data. This work examines a relatively new latent structure model, the Grade of Membership (GoM) model, integrating the GoM language and ideas with more standard statistical literature on latent variable models. The GoM model assumes that indi- viduals can have mixed membership in several subpopulations. Representing the GoM model as a constrained latent class model leads naturally to the Bayesian estimation framework developed and implemented in this dissertation. The analysis of a subset of functional disability data from the National Long Term Care survey provides an illustration of using the GoM and other latent structure models to describe the distribution of counts in a large sparse contingency table. Finally, a general class of mixed membership models is presented that unifies the latent structure of the GoM model and two other mixed membership models that recently appeared in the genetics and the machine learning literatures. i},

	Abstract = {Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.},

	Abstract = {One initial goal for the DRMF is to seed our digital compendium with fundamental orthogonal polynomial formulae. We had used the data from the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) as initial seed for our DRMF project. The DLMF input LaTeX source already contains some semantic information encoded using a highly customized set of semantic LaTeX macros. Those macros could be converted to content MathML using LaTeXML. During that conversion the semantics were translated to an implicit DLMF content dictionary. This year, we have developed a semantic enrichment process whose goal is to infer semantic information from generic LaTeX sources. The generated context-free semantic information is used to build DRMF formula home pages for each individual formula. We demonstrate this process using selected chapters from the book "Hypergeometric Orthogonal Polynomials and their {\$}q{\$}-Analogues" (2010) by Koekoek, Lesky and Swarttouw (KLS) as well as an actively maintained addendum to this book by Koornwinder (KLSadd). The generic input KLS and KLSadd LaTeX sources describe the printed representation of the formulae, but does not contain explicit semantic information. See http://drmf.wmflabs.org.},

To do this we (i) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (ii) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique -- segmented regression analysis -- which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (1) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (2) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1{\%} up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3{\%} up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9{\%} to 2012.},

@article{Lake2015,
	Abstract = {People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms---for action, imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world's alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We also present several " visual Turing tests " probing the model's creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior. D espite remarkable advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, two aspects of human conceptual knowledge have eluded machine systems. First, for most interesting kinds of natural and man-made categories, people can learn a new concept from just one or a handful of examples, whereas standard algorithms in machine learning require tens or hundreds of examples to perform simi-larly. For instance, people may only need to see one example of a novel two-wheeled vehicle (Fig. 1A) in order to grasp the boundaries of the new concept, and even children can make mean-ingful generalizations via " one-shot learning " (1--3). In contrast, many of the leading approaches in machine learning are also the most data-hungry, especially " deep learning " models that have achieved new levels of performance on object and speech recognition benchmarks (4--9). Sec-ond, people learn richer representations than machines do, even for simple concepts (Fig. 1B), using them for a wider range of functions, in-cluding (Fig. 1, ii) creating new exemplars (10), (Fig. 1, iii) parsing objects into parts and rela-tions (11), and (Fig. 1, iv) creating new abstract categories of objects based on existing categories (12, 13). In contrast, the best machine classifiers do not perform these additional functions, which are rarely studied and usually require special-ized algorithms. A central challenge is to ex-plain these two aspects of human-level concept learning: How do people learn new concepts from just one or a few examples? And how do people learn such abstract, rich, and flexible rep-resentations? An even greater challenge arises when putting them together: How can learning succeed from such sparse data yet also produce such rich representations? For any theory of RESEARCH},

The only under-lying LSTM structure that has been ex-plored so far is a linear chain. How-ever, natural language exhibits syntac-tic properties that would naturally com-bine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Senti-ment Treebank).},

Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

	Abstract = {Unsupervised word representations are very useful in NLP tasks both as inputs to learning algorithms and as extra word features in NLP systems. However, most of these models are built with only local context and one represen- tation per word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global con- text can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture the se- mantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context, and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning mul- tiple embeddings per word. We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outper- forms competitive baselines and other neural language models.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more popula-tions if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individu-als. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci---e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

We show that some basic algorithms can be learned from sequential data using a recurrent network associated with a trainable memory.},

Systems of interest range from single molecules (the sequence diversity in families of proteins) to groups of organisms (the distribution of velocities in flocks of birds), and all scales in between. Many of these analyses are motivated by the idea that biological systems may have evolved to optimize the gathering and representation of information, and we review the experimental evidence for this optimization, again across a wide range of scales.},

@article{Choi2010,
	Abstract = {We study the problem of learning a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efficient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our first algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efficient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world datasets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S{\&}P index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups dataset.},

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we explore how machine learning techniques can be applied to the discovery of efficient mathematical identities. We introduce an attribute grammar framework for representing symbolic expressions. Given a set of grammar rules we build trees that combine different rules, looking for branches which yield compositions that are analytically equivalent to a target expression, but of lower computational complexity. However, as the size of the trees grows exponentially with the complexity of the target expression, brute force search is impractical for all but the simplest of expressions. Consequently, we introduce two novel learning approaches that are able to learn from simpler expressions to guide the tree search. The first of these is a simple n-gram model, the other being a recursive neural-network. We show how these approaches enable us to derive complex identities, beyond reach of brute-force search, or human derivation.},

	Abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTM) are widely used because they are expressive and are easy to train. Our interest lies in empirically evaluating the expressiveness and the learnability of LSTMs in the sequence-to-sequence regime by training them to evaluate short computer programs, a domain that has traditionally been seen as too complex for neural networks. We consider a simple class of programs that can be evaluated with a single left-to-right pass using constant memory. Our main result is that LSTMs can learn to map the character-level representations of such programs to their correct outputs. Notably, it was necessary to use curriculum learning, and while conventional curriculum learning proved ineffective, we developed a new variant of curriculum learning that improved our networks' performance in all experimental conditions. The improved curriculum had a dramatic impact on an addition problem, making it possible to train an LSTM to add two 9-digit numbers with 99{\%} accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Continuous-valued word embeddings learned by neural language models have recently been shown to capture semantic and syntactic information aboutwords very well, setting performance records on severalword similarity tasks. The best results are obtained by learning high-dimensional embeddings from very large quantities of data, which makes scalability of the training method a critical factor. We propose a simple and scalable new approach to learning word embeddings based on training log-bilinear models with noise-contrastive estimation. Our approach is simpler, faster, and produces better results than the current state-of-the- art method. We achieve results comparable to the best ones reported, which were obtained on a cluster, using four times less data and more than an order of mag- nitude less computing time. We also investigate several model types and find that the embeddings learned by the simpler models perform at least as well as those learned by the more complex ones.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative filtering analyzes user preferences for items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants, academic papers) by exploiting the similarity patterns across users. In implicit feedback settings, all the items, including the ones that a user did not consume, are taken into consideration. But this assumption does not accord with the common sense understanding that users have a limited scope and awareness of items. For example, a user might not have heard of a certain paper, or might live too far away from a restaurant to experience it. In the language of causal analysis, the assignment mechanism (i.e., the items that a user is exposed to) is a latent variable that may change for various user/item combinations. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach that directly incorporates user exposure to items into collaborative filtering. The exposure is modeled as a latent variable and the model infers its value from data. In doing so, we recover one of the most successful state-of-the-art approaches as a special case of our model, and provide a plug-in method for conditioning exposure on various forms of exposure covariates (e.g., topics in text, venue locations). We show that our scalable inference algorithm outperforms existing benchmarks in four different domains both with and without exposure covariates.},

Instead of concatenating word representations, we appeal to tensor algebra and use low-rank n-gram tensors to directly exploit interactions between words already at the convolution stage. Moreover, we extend the n-gram convolution to non-consecutive words to recognize patterns with intervening words. Through a combination of low-rank tensors, and pattern weighting, we can efficiently evaluate the resulting convolution operation via dynamic programming. We test the resulting architecture on standard sentiment classification and news categorization tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of accuracy and training speed. For instance, we obtain 51.4{\%} accuracy on the fine-grained sentiment classification task.},

	Abstract = {Deep neural networks are powerful parametric models that can be trained efficiently using the backpropagation algorithm. Stochastic neural networks combine the power of large parametric functions with that of graphical models, which makes it possible to learn very complex distributions. However, as backpropagation is not directly applicable to stochastic networks that include discrete sampling operations within their computational graph, training such networks remains difficult. We present MuProp, an unbiased gradient estimator for stochastic networks, designed to make this task easier. MuProp improves on the likelihood-ratio estimator by reducing its variance using a control variate based on the first-order Taylor expansion of a mean-field network. Crucially, unlike prior attempts at using backpropagation for training stochastic networks, the resulting estimator is unbiased and well behaved. Our experiments on structured output prediction and discrete latent variable modeling demonstrate that MuProp yields consistently good performance across a range of difficult tasks.},

@article{ShixiangGu2015,
	Abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is a popular class of methods for sampling from an intractable target distribution using a sequence of simpler intermediate distributions. Like other importance sampling-based methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution. This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible, applicable to any parameterised proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich parameterisations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC significantly improves inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a neural network-based deep recurrent generative model achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference.},

	Abstract = {Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

	Abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved impressive supervised classification performance in many tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, and sequence to sequence learning. However, this success has not been translated to applications like question answering that may involve complex arithmetic and logic reasoning. A major limitation of these models is in their inability to learn even simple arithmetic and logic operations. For example, it has been shown that neural networks fail to learn to add two binary numbers reliably. In this work, we propose Neural Programmer, an end-to-end differentiable neural network augmented with a small set of basic arithmetic and logic operations. Neural Programmer can call these augmented operations over several steps, thereby inducing compositional programs that are more complex than the built-in operations. The model learns from a weak supervision signal which is the result of execution of the correct program, hence it does not require expensive annotation of the correct program itself. The decisions of what operations to call, and what data segments to apply to are inferred by Neural Programmer. Such decisions, during training, are done in a differentiable fashion so that the entire network can be trained jointly by gradient descent. We find that training the model is difficult, but it can be greatly improved by adding random noise to the gradient. On a fairly complex synthetic table-comprehension dataset, traditional recurrent networks and attentional models perform poorly while Neural Programmer typically obtains nearly perfect accuracy.},

	Abstract = {We analyze skip-gram with negative-sampling (SGNS), a word embedding method introduced by Mikolov et al., and show that it is implicitly factorizing a word-context matrix, whose cells are the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the respective word and context pairs, shifted by a global constant. We find that another embedding method, NCE, is implicitly factorizing a similar matrix, where each cell is the (shifted) log conditional probability of a word given its context. We show that using a sparse Shifted Positive PMI word-context matrix to represent words improves results on two word similarity tasks and one of two analogy tasks. When dense low-dimensional vectors are preferred, exact factorization with SVD can achieve solutions that are at least as good as SGNS's solutions for word simi-larity tasks. On analogy questions SGNS remains superior to SVD. We conjecture that this stems from the weighted nature of SGNS's factorization.},

	Abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists.},

Many such models are `sloppy', i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher Information Matrix, which we interpret as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. We show how the manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

	Abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

@misc{Kingman1995,
	Abstract = {Two fundamental theories are commonly debated in the study of random processes: the Bachelier Wiener model of Brownian motion, which has been the subject of many books, and the Poisson process. While nearly every book mentions the Poisson process, most hurry past to more general point processes or to Markov chains. This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general contexts. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records the author's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions. The mathematical theory is powerful and a few key results often produce surprising consequences.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent ``statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a X 2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

	Abstract = {Semantic word embeddings use vector representations to represent the meaning of a word. Methods to create them include Vector Space Methods (VSMs) such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), matrix factorization, generative text models such as Topic Models, and neural nets. A flurry of work has resulted from the papers of Mikolov et al.{\~{}}$\backslash$cite{\{}mikolov2013efficient{\}}. These showed how to solve word analogy tasks very well by leveraging linear structure in word embeddings even though the embeddings were created using highly nonlinear energy based models. No clear explanation is known why such linear structure emerges in low-dimensional embeddings. This paper presents a loglinear generative model---related to{\~{}}$\backslash$citet{\{}mnih2007three{\}}---that models the generation of a text corpus as a random walk in a latent discourse space. A novel methodological twist is that the model is solved in closed form by integrating out the random walk. This yields a simple method for constructing word embeddings. Experiments are presented to support the modeling assumptions as well as the efficacy of the word embeddings for solving analogies. This simple model links and provides theoretical support for several prior methods for finding embeddings, as well as provides interpretations for various linear algebraic structures in word embeddings obtained from nonlinear techniques.},

	Abstract = {Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems. Quantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation to probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high predictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data science. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general nonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights into the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part of this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more efficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit low-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional probabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize a useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that sparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce a method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g., personality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part of the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe that the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete with state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore, we make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical orderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection between data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication complexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations) and physics (quantum models).},

	Abstract = {Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80{\%} up to 85.4{\%}. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7{\%}, an improvement of 9.7{\%} over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.},

	Abstract = {Tree-structured recursive neural networks (TreeRNNs) for sentence meaning have been successful for many applications, but it remains an open question whether the fixed-length representations that they learn can support tasks as demanding as logical deduction. We pursue this question by evaluating whether two such models---plain TreeRNNs and tree-structured neural tensor networks (TreeRNTNs)---can correctly learn to identify logical relationships such as entailment and contradiction using these representations. In our first set of experiments, we generate artificial data from a logical grammar and use it to evaluate the models' ability to learn to handle basic relational reasoning, recursive structures, and quantification. We then evaluate the models on the more natural SICK challenge data. Both models perform competitively on the SICK data and generalize well in all three experiments on simulated data, suggesting that they can learn suitable representations for logical inference in natural language.},

	Abstract = {Spin ices, frustrated magnetic materials analogous to common water ice, are exemplars of high frustration in three dimensions. Recent experimental studies of the low-temperature properties of the paradigmatic Dy{\$}{\_}2{\$}Ti{\$}{\_}2{\$}O{\$}{\_}7{\$} spin ice material, in particular whether the predicted transition to long-range order occurs, raise questions as per the currently accepted microscopic model of this system. In this work, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory calculations to analyze data from magnetization, elastic neutron scattering and specific heat measurements on Dy{\$}{\_}2{\$}Ti{\$}{\_}2{\$}O{\$}{\_}7{\$}. We also reconsider the possible importance of the nuclear specific heat, {\$}C{\_}{\{}\backslashrm nuc{\}}{\$}, in Dy{\$}{\_}2{\$}Ti{\$}{\_}2{\$}O{\$}{\_}7{\$}. We find that {\$}C{\_}{\{}\backslashrm nuc{\}}{\$} is not entirely negligible below a temperature {\$}\backslashsim 0.5{\$} K and must be taken into account in a quantitative analysis of the calorimetric data of this compound below that temperature. We find that small effective exchange interactions compete with the magnetostatic dipolar interaction responsible for the main spin ice phenomenology. This causes an unexpected "refrustration" of the long-range order that would be expected from the incompletely self-screened dipolar interaction and which positions the material at the boundary between two competing classical long-range ordered ground states. This allows for the manifestation of new physical low-temperature phenomena in Dy{\$}{\_}2{\$}Ti{\$}{\_}2{\$}O{\$}{\_}7{\$}, as exposed by recent specific heat measurements. We show that among the four most likely causes for the observed upturn of the specific heat at low temperature -- an exchange-induced transition to long-range order, quantum non-Ising (transverse) terms in the effective spin Hamiltonian, the nuclear hyperfine contribution and random disorder -- only the last appears to be reasonably able to explain the calorimetric data.},

	Abstract = {This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h $\Omega$ to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the - oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

In particular, keyword search is insufficient when expressions in a document are not annotated with natural keywords or the user cannot describe her query with keywords. Retrieving documents by querying their mathematical content directly is very appealing in various domains such as education, digital libraries, engineering, patent documents, medical sciences, etc. Capturing the relevance of mathematical expressions also greatly enhances document classification in such domains. Unlike text retrieval, where keywords carry enough semantics to distinguish text documents and rank them, math symbols do not contain much semantic information on their own. In fact, mathematical expressions typically consist of few alphabetical symbols organized in rather complex structures. Hence, the structure of an expression, which describes the way such symbols are combined, should also be considered. Unfortunately, there is no standard testbed with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a mathematics retrieval algorithm. In this paper we study the fundamental and challenging problems in mathematics retrieval, that is how to capture the relevance of mathematical expressions, how to query them, and how to evaluate the results. We describe various search paradigms and propose retrieval systems accordingly. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and further compare them through an extensive empirical study.},

	Abstract = {Experiments in particle physics produce enormous quantities of data that must be analyzed and interpreted by teams of physicists. This analysis is often exploratory, where scientists are unable to enumerate the possible types of signal prior to performing the experiment. Thus, tools for summarizing, clustering, visualizing and classifying high-dimensional data are essential. In this work, we show that meaningful physical content can be revealed by transforming the raw data into a learned high-level representation using deep neural networks, with measurements taken at the Daya Bay Neutrino Experiment as a case study. We further show how convolutional deep neural networks can provide an effective classification filter with greater than 97{\%} accuracy across different classes of physics events, significantly better than other machine learning approaches.},

	Abstract = {Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on 'shallow' machine-learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions of the inputs, and rely on a painstaking search through manually constructed nonlinear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Here, using benchmark data sets, we show that deep-learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8{\%} over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep-learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.},

	Abstract = {Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU score improvements on Flickr30k, from 55 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 27.},

These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},

We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice. We will make our encoder publicly available.},

We argue that problems of this kind fit naturally into the realm of geostatistics, which traditionally is defined as the study of spatially continuous processes using spatially discrete observations at a finite number of locations. We suggest that a more useful definition of geostatistics is by the class of scientific problems that it addresses, rather than by particular models or data formats.},

	Abstract = {Many questions of fundamental interest in todays science can be formulated as inference problems: Some partial, or noisy, observations are performed over a set of variables and the goal is to recover, or infer, the values of the variables based on the indirect information contained in the measurements. For such problems, the central scientific questions are: Under what conditions is the information contained in the measurements sufficient for a satisfactory inference to be possible? What are the most efficient algorithms for this task? A growing body of work has shown that often we can understand and locate these fundamental barriers by thinking of them as phase transitions in the sense of statistical physics. Moreover, it turned out that we can use the gained physical insight to develop new promising algorithms. Connection between inference and statistical physics is currently witnessing an impressive renaissance and we review here the current state-of-the-art, with a pedagogical focus on the Ising model which formulated as an inference problem we call the planted spin glass. In terms of applications we review two classes of problems: (i) inference of clusters on graphs and networks, with community detection as a special case and (ii) estimating a signal from its noisy linear measurements, with compressed sensing as a case of sparse estimation. Our goal is to provide a pedagogical review for researchers in physics and other fields interested in this fascinating topic.},

	Abstract = {Many questions of fundamental interest in todays science can be formulated as inference problems: Some partial, or noisy, observations are performed over a set of variables and the goal is to recover, or infer, the values of the variables based on the indirect information contained in the measurements. For such problems, the central scientific questions are: Under what conditions is the information contained in the measurements sufficient for a satisfactory inference to be possible? What are the most efficient algorithms for this task? A growing body of work has shown that often we can understand and locate these fundamental barriers by thinking of them as phase transitions in the sense of statistical physics. Moreover, it turned out that we can use the gained physical insight to develop new promising algorithms. Connection between inference and statistical physics is currently witnessing an impressive renaissance and we review here the current state-of-the-art, with a pedagogical focus on the Ising model which formulated as an inference problem we call the planted spin glass. In terms of applications we review two classes of problems: (i) inference of clusters on graphs and networks, with community detection as a special case and (ii) estimating a signal from its noisy linear measurements, with compressed sensing as a case of sparse estimation. Our goal is to provide a pedagogical review for researchers in physics and other fields interested in this fascinating topic.},

@article{Chen2014,
	Abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling methods provide a mechanism for defining distant proposals with high acceptance probabilities in a Metropolis-Hastings framework, enabling more efficient exploration of the state space than standard random-walk proposals. The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recent years. However, a limitation of HMC methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system---such a computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient HMC approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of building generative models of natural source code (NSC); that is, source code written and understood by humans. Our primary contribution is to describe a family of generative models for NSC that have three key properties: First, they incorporate both sequential and hierarchical structure. Second, we learn a distributed representation of source code elements. Finally, they integrate closely with a compiler, which allows leveraging compiler logic and abstractions when building structure into the model. We also develop an extension that includes more complex structure, refining how the model generates identifier tokens based on what variables are currently in scope. Our models can be learned efficiently, and we show empirically that including appropriate structure greatly improves the models, measured by the probability of generating test programs.},

@article{Blei,
	Abstract = {as OUr COLLeCTive knowledge continues to be digitized and stored---in the form of news, blogs, Web pages, scientific articles, books, images, sound, video, and social networks---it becomes more difficult to find and discover what we are looking for. We need new computational tools to help organize, search, and understand these vast amounts of information. Right now, we work with online information using two main tools---search and links. We type keywords into a search engine and find a set of documents related to them. We look at the documents in that set, possibly navigating to other linked documents. This is a powerful way of interacting with our online archive, but something is missing. Imagine searching and exploring documents based on the themes that run through them. We might " zoom in " and " zoom out " to find specific or broader themes; we might look at how those themes changed through time or how they are connected to each other. Rather than finding documents through keyword search alone, we might first find the theme that we are interested in, and then examine the documents related to that theme. For example, consider using themes to explore the complete history of the New York Times. At a broad level, some of the themes might correspond to the sections of the newspaper---for-eign policy, national affairs, sports. We could zoom in on a theme of in-terest, such as foreign policy, to reveal various aspects of it---Chinese foreign policy, the conflict in the Middle East, the U.S.'s relationship with Russia. We could then navigate through time to reveal how these specific themes have changed, tracking, for example, the changes in the conflict in the Middle East over the last 50 years. And, in all of this exploration, we would be pointed to the original articles relevant to the themes. The thematic structure would be a new kind of window through which to explore and digest the collection. But we do not interact with elec-tronic archives in this way. While more and more texts are available online, we simply do not have the human power to read and study them to provide the kind of browsing experience described above. To this end, machine learning researchers have developed probabilis-tic topic modeling, a suite of algorithms that aim to discover and annotate large archives of documents with thematic information. Topic modeling algo-rithms are statistical methods that ana-lyze the words of the original texts to discover the themes that run through them, how those themes are connected to each other, and how they change over key insights},

In this paper, we propose the tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) to model programming languages, which contain rich and explicit tree structural information. In our model, program vector representations are learned by the "coding" pretraining criterion based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs); the convolutional layer explicitly captures neighboring features on the tree; with the "binary continuous tree" and "3-way pooling," our model can deal with ASTs of different shapes and sizes.We evaluate the program vector representations empirically, showing that the coding criterion successfully captures underlying features of AST nodes, and that program vector representations significantly speed up supervised learning. We also compare TBCNN to baseline methods; our model achieves better accuracy in the task of program classification. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze programs with deep neural networks; we extend the scope of deep learning to the field of programming language processing. The experimental results validate its feasibility; they also show a promising future of this new research area.},

	Abstract = {Children acquiring language infer the correct form of syntactic constructions for which they appear to have little or no direct evidence, avoiding simple but incorrect generalizations that would be consistent with the data they receive. These generalizations must be guided by some inductive bias - some abstract knowledge - that leads them to prefer the correct hypotheses even in the absence of directly supporting evidence. What form do these inductive constraints take? It is often argued or assumed that they reflect innately specified knowledge of language. A classic example of such an argument moves from the phenomenon of auxiliary fronting in English interrogatives to the conclusion that children must innately know that syntactic rules are defined over hierarchical phrase structures rather than linear sequences of words (e.g., Chomsky, 1965, 1971, 1980; Crain {\&} Nakayama, 1987). Here we use a Bayesian framework for grammar induction to address a version of this argument and show that, given typical child-directed speech and certain innate domain-general capacities, an ideal learner could recognize the hierarchical phrase structure of language without having this knowledge innately specified as part of the language faculty.

	Abstract = {We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i) variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii) uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

Scientific theories are plausibly regarded as organized into hierarchies in many cases, with higher levels sometimes called 'paradigms' and lower levels encoding more specific or concrete hypotheses. Therefore, HBMs provide a useful model for scientific theory change, showing how higher-level theory change may be driven by the impact of evidence on lower levels. HBMs capture features described in the Kuhnian tradition, particularly the idea that higher-level theories guide learning at lower levels. In addition, they help resolve certain issues for Bayesians, such as scientific preference for simplicity and tbe problem of new theories.},

	Abstract = {The activity of a neural network is defined by patterns of spiking and silence from the individual neurons. Because spikes are (relatively) sparse, patterns of activity with increasing numbers of spikes are less probable, but, with more spikes, the number of possible patterns increases. This tradeoff between probability and numerosity is mathematically equivalent to the relationship between entropy and energy in statistical physics. We construct this relationship for populations of up to N = 160 neurons in a small patch of the vertebrate retina, using a combination of direct and model-based analyses of experiments on the response of this network to naturalistic movies. We see signs of a thermodynamic limit, where the entropy per neuron approaches a smooth function of the energy per neuron as N increases. The form of this function corresponds to the distribution of activity being poised near an unusual kind of critical point. We suggest further tests of criticality, and give a brief discussion of its functional significance.},

	Abstract = {The current study characterized the in vitro surface reactions of microroughened bioactive glasses and compared osteoblast cell responses between smooth and microrough surfaces. Three different bioactive glass compositions were used and surface microroughening was obtained using a novel chemical etching method. Porous bioactive glass specimens made of sintered microspheres were immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) or Tris solutions for 1, 6, 24, 48, or 72 h, and the formation of reaction layers was studied by means of a scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDXA). Cell culture studies were performed on bioactive glass disks to examine the influence of surface microroughness on the attachment and proliferation of human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63). Cell attachment was evaluated by means of microscopic counting of in situ stained cells. Cell proliferation was analyzed with a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay combined with in situ staining and laser confocal microscopy. The microroughening of the bioactive glass surface increased the rate of the silica gel layer formation during the first hours of the immersion. The formation of calcium phosphate layer was equal between control and microroughened glass surfaces. In cell cultures on bioactive glass, the microrough surface enhanced the attachment of osteoblast-like cells but did not have an effect on the proliferation rate or morphology of the cells as compared with smooth glass surface. In conclusion, accelerated the early formation of surface reactions on three bioactive glasses and had a positive effect on initial cell attachment.},

We prove this by showing the method is algorithmically stable in the sense of Bousquet and Elisseeff. Our analysis only employs elementary tools from convex and continuous optimization. Our results apply to both convex and non-convex optimization under standard Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions. Applying our results to the convex case, we provide new explanations for why multiple epochs of stochastic gradient descent generalize well in practice. In the nonconvex case, we provide a new interpretation of common practices in neural networks, and provide a formal rationale for stability-promoting mechanisms in training large, deep models. Conceptually, our findings underscore the importance of reducing training time beyond its obvious benefit.},

Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks---the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of a parser's state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, (ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.},

The filter also yields a spamminess score, intended to reflect the likelihood that the classified message is spam, which is the subject of post-hoc ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis. The gold standard for each message is communicated to the filter immediately following classification. Eight test corpora -- email messages plus gold standard judgements -- were used to evaluate 53 subject filters. Five of the corpora (the public corpora) were distributed to participants, who ran their filters on the corpora using a track-supplied toolkit implementing the framework. Three of the corpora (the private corpora) were not distributed to participants; rather, participants submitted filter implementations that were run, using the toolkit, on the private data. Twelve groups participated in the track, submitting 44 filters for evaluation. The other nine subject filters were variants of popular open-source implementations adapted for use in the toolkit in consultation with their authors.},

However, these models have at best only slightly outperformed simpler sequence-based models. We hypothesize that neural sequence models like LSTMs are in fact able to discover and implicitly use recursive compositional structure, at least for tasks with clear cues to that structure in the data. We demonstrate this possibility using an artificial data task for which recursive compositional structure is crucial, and find that the sequence model can learn the underlying patterning. The sequence model is better in that it learns the value of tree structure from the data in an emergent way, while the tree-structured model is better in being able to learn with greater statistical efficiency due to its informative prior model structure.},

	Abstract = {Variational methods are a key component of the approximate inference and learning toolbox. These methods fill an important middle ground, retaining distributional information about uncertainty in latent variables, unlike maximum a posteriori methods (MAP), and yet generally requiring less computational time than Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. In particular the variational Expectation Maximisation (vEM) and variational Bayes algorithms, both involving variational optimisation of a free-energy, are widely used in time-series modelling. Here, we investigate the success of vEM in simple probabilistic time-series models. First we consider the inference step of vEM, and show that a consequence of the well-known compactness property of variational inference is a failure to propagate uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of the retained distributional information. In particular, the uncertainty may appear to be smallest precisely when the approximation is poorest. Second, we consider parameter learning and analytically reveal systematic biases in the parameters found by vEM. Surprisingly, simpler variational approxi- mations (such a mean-field) can lead to less bias than more complicated structured approximations.},

	Abstract = {Representations offered by deep generative models are fundamentally tied to their inference method from data. Variational inference methods require a rich family of approximating distributions. We construct the variational Gaussian process (VGP), a Bayesian nonparametric model which adapts its shape to match complex posterior distributions. The VGP generates approximate posterior samples by generating latent inputs and warping them through random non-linear mappings; the distribution over random mappings is learned during inference, enabling the transformed outputs to adapt to varying complexity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for the VGP, demonstrating its representative power for learning any model. For inference we present a variational objective inspired by autoencoders and perform black box inference over a wide class of models. The VGP achieves new state-of-the-art results for unsupervised learning, inferring models such as the deep latent Gaussian model and the recently proposed DRAW.},

@article{Wang2013,
	Abstract = {Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.},

In this paper we benchmark {\{}$\backslash$bf recursive{\}} neural models against sequential {\{}$\backslash$bf recurrent{\}} neural models (simple recurrent and LSTM models).

We implement carefully matched versions of recursive and recurrent models and apply them to each task. Our analysis suggests that sequence-based recurrent models achieve equal or better performance in most tasks with the exception that syntactic tree-based recursive models are particularly helpful for tasks that require representing long-distance relations between words (e.g., semantic relations between nominals). Our results help understand the limitations of both classes of models, and suggest directions for improving recurrent models $\backslash$footnote{\{}Code for models described in Section 3.1 on Stanford Treebank dataset are released at$\backslash$url{\{}http://web.stanford.edu/{\~{}}jiweil/{\}}.{\}}.},

@article{Charlton2009,
	Abstract = {QUESTION: why are so many leading modern scientists so dull and lacking in scientific ambition? ANSWER: because the science selection process ruthlessly weeds-out interesting and imaginative people. At each level in education, training and career progression there is a tendency to exclude smart and creative people by preferring Conscientious and Agreeable people. The progressive lengthening of scientific training and the reduced independence of career scientists have tended to deter vocational 'revolutionary' scientists in favour of industrious and socially adept individuals better suited to incremental 'normal' science. High general intelligence (IQ) is required for revolutionary science. But educational attainment depends on a combination of intelligence and the personality trait of Conscientiousness; and these attributes do not correlate closely. Therefore elite scientific institutions seeking potential revolutionary scientists need to use IQ tests as well as examination results to pick-out high IQ 'under-achievers'. As well as high IQ, revolutionary science requires high creativity. Creativity is probably associated with moderately high levels of Eysenck's personality trait of 'Psychoticism'. Psychoticism combines qualities such as selfishness, independence from group norms, impulsivity and sensation-seeking; with a style of cognition that involves fluent, associative and rapid production of many ideas. But modern science selects for high Conscientiousness and high Agreeableness; therefore it enforces low Psychoticism and low creativity. Yet my counter-proposal to select elite revolutionary scientists on the basis of high IQ and moderately high Psychoticism may sound like a recipe for disaster, since resembles a formula for choosing gifted charlatans and confidence tricksters. A further vital ingredient is therefore necessary: devotion to the transcendental value of Truth. Elite revolutionary science should therefore be a place that welcomes brilliant, impulsive, inspired, antisocial oddballs - so long as they are also dedicated truth-seekers.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk (G{\"{a}}rtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005) and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mah{\'{e}} et al., 2004) graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n 6) to O(n 3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel ma-trices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn 3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge ker-nels, and O(n 4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n 2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of mag-nitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of Fr{\"{o}}hlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite.},

	Abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE) can be highly influenced by the presence of unusual data points. A generalization of the GEE procedure, which yields parameter estimates and fitted values that are resistant to influential data, is introduced. Resistant generalized estimating equations (REGEE) include weights in the estimating equations to downweight influential observations or clusters. Influential observations are downweighted according to their leverage or residual in an example of correlated binary regression applied to 137 urinary incontinent elderly patients from 38 medical practices.},

	Abstract = {We investigate robustness in the logistic regression model.
       Copas has studied two forms of robust estimator: a robust-resistant
         estimate of Pregibon and an estimate based on a misclassification
         model. He concluded that robust-resistant estimates are much more
         biased in small samples than the usual logistic estimate is and
         recommends a bias-corrected version of the misclassification estimate.
         We show that there are other versions of robust-resistant estimates
         which have bias often approximately the same as and sometimes even less
         than the logistic estimate; these estimates belong to the Mallows
         class. In addition, the corrected misclassification estimate is
         inconsistent at the logistic model; we develop a simple consistent
         modification. The modified estimate is a member of the Mallows class
         but, unlike most robust estimates, it has an interpretable tuning
         constant. The results are illustrated on data sets featuring different
         kinds of outliers.},
