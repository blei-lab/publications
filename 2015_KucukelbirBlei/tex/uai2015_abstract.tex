Bayesian predictive inference analyzes a dataset to make predictions about new
observations. When a model does not match the data, predictive accuracy suffers.
We develop \gls{POPEB}, a hierarchical framework that explicitly models the
empirical population distribution as part of Bayesian analysis. We introduce a
new concept, the latent dataset, as a hierarchical variable and set the
empirical population as its prior. This leads to a new predictive density that
mitigates model mismatch.  We efficiently apply this method to complex models by
proposing a stochastic variational inference algorithm, called \gls{BUMPVI}.  We
demonstrate improved predictive accuracy over classical Bayesian inference in
three models: a linear regression model of health data, a Bayesian mixture model
of natural images, and a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model of scientific
documents.
